## ⚡ Quickstart

### 1. Backend Setup

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```env
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=aws-us-east-1
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=demo
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```powershell
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```powershell
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📝 Usage

1. **Upload PDFs:** Go to the upload page and submit your PDF (with a source URL for citation).
2. **Chat:** Switch to the chat page and ask questions about your documents.
3. **See Sources:** Click "Show Sources" under any answer to view the exact context and document links used.
4. **Enjoy Streaming:** Watch answers appear in real-time, formatted with Markdown for easy reading.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **PDF Upload:**
   - PDFs are split into batches and chunked for memory efficiency.
   - Each chunk is embedded and upserted to Pinecone with full source metadata (filename, URL, chunk index).
   - Upload progress is shown in real time.
2. **Chat:**
   - User questions are sent to the backend.
   - The backend retrieves the top relevant chunks from Pinecone (with metadata).
   - Gemini Pro LLM generates a Markdown-formatted answer, streamed to the frontend.
   - Source metadata is sent alongside the answer for full transparency.
3. **Frontend:**
   - Modern, full-screen chat UI with Markdown rendering and toggles for source context.
   - Upload page with progress bar and error handling.

## 🛡️ Notes & Tips

- Ensure your Pinecone index dimension matches your embedding model (default: 384 for all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
- CORS is configured for local development.
- For production, secure your API keys and use HTTPS.
- All code is modular and easy to extend for new features or models.
